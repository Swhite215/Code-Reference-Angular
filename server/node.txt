Node Fundamentals
    1. What is Node?
        a. Runtime
            - Allows you to run JavaScript on the server side/outside of the browser
            - Uses the v8 engine and uses JIT compilation
    2. How does it work?
        a. Event Loop
            - Continously running event loop if events are registered
            - Blocking
                - Stops execution of code on the thread
                - Any Sync methods
            - Non-Blocking
                - Does not stop execution of code on the thread
                - Promises, Event Callbacks, Async/Await code
        b. Node Modules
            - All files are wrapped with code as a Modules
            - Components of a module
                - __filename
                - __dirname
                - module
                - require
                - exports
        c. NPM Scripts
            - NPM
                - Node Package Manager
            - Commands
                - npm init, initializes a project and builds a package.json file
                - npm start
                - npm test
                - npm run command
