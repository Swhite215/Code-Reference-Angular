Node Fundamentals
    1. What is Node?
        a. Runtime
            - Allows you to run JavaScript on the server side/outside of the browser
            - Uses the v8 engine and uses JIT compilation
    2. How does it work?
        a. Event Loop
            - Continously running event loop if events are registered
            - Blocking
                - Stops execution of code on the thread
                - Any Sync methods
            - Non-Blocking
                - Does not stop execution of code on the thread
                - Promises, Event Callbacks, Async/Await code
        b. Node Modules
            - All files are wrapped with code as a Modules
            - Components of a module
                - __filename
                - __dirname
                - module
                - require
                - exports
        c. NPM Scripts
            - NPM
                - Node Package Manager
            - Commands
                - npm init, initializes a project and builds a package.json file
                - npm start
                - npm test
                - npm run command
            - Installing Packages
                - npm install package
                - npm install package@version
                - npm install -g package
                - npm install --save-dev package
                - npm install --save package
            - Packages
                - Express, framework for restless server
                - Nodemon, development tool for process management, restarting
        d. Errors
            - Syntax Errors
            - Runtime Errors
            - Logical Errors
    3. Express
        a. What is Express?
            - A framework for building servers
        b. Middlware
            - A function that is run in between every request
            - Use next() to allow the request to continue to the next middlware
        c. Routes
            - app.use(cb) to pass middleware to all requests
            - app.use('/path', cb) to add middleware to specific paths
            - app.get, app.post, app.put, app.delete to add route handlers for HTTP methods
